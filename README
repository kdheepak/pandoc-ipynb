This pandoc filter allows you to use a liquid tag style statement to link a jupyter notebook into a pelican blog with pandoc as the reader.

# Usage Example

> {% notebook power.ipynb %}

The notebook must be placed in `content/notebooks/`

The filter should be added to `PANDOC_ARGS`

    PANDOC_ARGS = [
        ...
      '--filter=./convert-ipynb.py',
        ...
    ]

The filter must be placed in the root directory of the blog repository
